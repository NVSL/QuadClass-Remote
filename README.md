## Laser Cutting

The plywood base and the "donuts" used for standoffs are all in the
`.brd` file.  Open it, hide everything but the `baseplate` layer.
Print it to a PDF and feed it to your laser cutter.

The wooden parts are cut from 3mm plywood (see parts list).

## The Gimbals

The gimbals attach to the baseplate with the 8 long machine screws and 8 nuts.  

## Board

The control board mounts to the baseplate using the shorter screws and nuts.  Use 3 donuts to put space between the board and the baseplate.


## Battery Cable

Red is positive.

Attach the battery and tuck it under the board.  You can trim the battery cable, if you want.  Experiment with different lengths.
