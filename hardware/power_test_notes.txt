Design notes for RC1

1.  FTDI works ok, but only the green LED lights up.  Not sure why. -- Fixed
2.  The mux and switches work fine. 
3.  Battery charger seems to charge batteries, but LEDs don't light up.  I can light up green manually.  Red is a no go. -- fixed
4.  Some how blew C8. -- na
5.  Using PWREN to enable the battery charger may not be a good idea.  Will it work with a "wall wart" ***

6.  The solder stencil applied a little too much paste.  I had some bridges on ftdi and mux. -- make sure it's very flat to the board.  Works fine.
7.  When disconnected from USB and connected to power, VBAT sits at 2.7V.  -- powered via switch.
8.  When J5 is not connected to anything, D5 flashes for ever, which suggests that FTDI is resetting. -- unclear.
9.  Connecting VBAT ot FTDI via J5, causes slower flashing.  Maybe something capacitors and the mosfet?  -- unclear
10.  connecting VBUS to FTDI powers it correctly.

11.  The switch chip will drive it's vdd high if you connect power to pins, but leave VDD in floating.
12.  The polarity of my red leds is backwards. WTF???? *******

In order to use them FTDI voltage regulator, we have to have mosfet:  We are driving the FTDI with two different voltage sources: VBUS and VBAT (driven by charger), they are different, so one must be disconnected.  A diode by itself might do...  We can replace the pfet with a diode to prevent current from flowing back onto the battery from vbus.  This seems to work.

13.  The power switch needs to be in a different spot.  Turning it off disables ftdi when connected to VBUS.  Without vbus, FTDI red led is on a bit when switch is off.  Battery charge lites are both on a little --fixed

Current plan:

Assemble second board:

1.  DNP Diode, mosfet, and separate vreg.  mux, too.
2.  Test battery status voltage before assembly.
3.  Test red LEDs.  None of them work.  Did I overdrive them?  100Ohms at 5V > 32mA, which is 2mA over absolute max.  Try 200Ohms.  Shouldn't been a problem for batt charger because outut should be 5V-0.4 => 28mA
4.  Check whether wall wart charging works.


Red leds turn on nicely at 1.6V @ 6mA

V = IR
V = 5-1.6 = 3.4
I = 6mA 
R = V/I = 3.4/6e-3 = 566Ohms.  Using 510 for R6

For Battery charger:

4.6-1.6 = 3
I = 6mA
R = 500 Ohms.  Using 510 for R8


green leds light up nicely at 1.9V 5mA

V = 5-1.9 = 3.1
R = 3.1/5e-3 =620 Ohms

4.6 - 1.9 = 2.7
R = 2.7/5e-3 = 540Ohms

Using 510 for R9 R7

V = 3.3-1.9 = 1.4
R = 1.4=5e-3 = 280Ohms for power LED

Using 270 on R11




V=IR 
V=0.81
r = 510

I = V/R
