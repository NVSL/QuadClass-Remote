Design notes for RC1

1.  FTDI works ok, but only the green LED lights up.  Not sure why.
2.  The mux and switches work fine.
3.  Battery charger seems to charge batteries, but LEDs don't light up.  I can light up green manually.  Red is a no go.
4.  Some how blew C8.
5.  Using PWREN to enable the battery charger may not be a good idea.  Will it work with a "wall wart"

6.  The solder stencil applied a little too much paste.  I had some bridges on ftdi and mux.
7.  When disconnected from USB and connected to power, VBAT sits at 2.7V.
8.  When J5 is not connected to anything, D5 flashes for ever, which suggests that FTDI is resetting.
9.  Connecting VBAT ot FTDI via J5, causes slower flashing.  Maybe something capacitors and the mosfet?
10.  connecting VBUS to FTDI powers it correctly.

Current plan:

Assemble second board:

1.  DNP Diode, mosfet, and separate vreg.  mux, too.
2.  Test battery status voltage before assembly.
3.  Test red LEDs.  None of them work.  Did I overdrive them?  100Ohms at 5V > 32mA, which is 2mA over absolute max.  Try 200Ohms.  Shouldn't been a problem for batt charger because outut should be 5V-0.4 => 28mA
4.  Check whether wall wart charging works.
